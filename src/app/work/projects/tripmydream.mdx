## Overview

This project focused on building a high-performance travel platform that combines metasearch discovery with planning content. The goal was to help users compare flight and hotel offers, explore destinations with flexible parameters, and navigate promo deals and guides through a fast, SEO-friendly experience. tripmydream positions itself as a travel service that helps users find, compare, and buy flights and rooms worldwide while providing travel information and guides

## Key Features

- **Flights & Hotels Metasearch**: Developed search interfaces for flights and hotels with filtering, sorting, pagination, and unified offer normalization across multiple providers.
- **Flexible Search & Discovery**: Implemented open-date and flexible-destination discovery flows, including price-based browsing and scalable dynamic routes for directions and locations.
- **Deals & Promo Engine**: Built deal surfaces and promo listings for cheapest offers and curated directions, with reusable blocks for “top deals” and “best prices” sections.
- **Price Alerts & Monitoring**: Implemented subscription-style price tracking UX, notification-ready logic, and persistence of monitored routes and preferences.
- **SEO Content Hub**: Created scalable templates for destination guides, travel tips, and landing pages with structured metadata, internal linking modules, and sitemap-ready architecture.


## Technologies Used

- **React and Next.js**: Built the front-end codebase with reusable components and SSR/SSG/ISR patterns for SEO-critical and long-tail pages.
- **TypeScript**: Added strict typing for offers, destinations, content models, and API clients to improve maintainability and reduce regressions.
- **API Integrations**: Integrated partner feeds and internal endpoints, including rate-limit handling, retries, caching layers, and schema normalization.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented caching strategies, asset optimization, lazy loading, bundle splitting, and Core Web Vitals-focused delivery.
- **Localization & International SEO**: Implemented locale-aware routing, hreflang, currency/date localization, and translation-ready content structure for multilingual reach.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Automated build, test, and deployment workflows with GitHub Actions, including lint/typecheck gates and environment-based configuration.



## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was balancing large-scale search UX with content-rich destination planning without compromising performance. Another challenge was maintaining SEO stability across dynamic search interfaces and a wide content surface area. The solution required consistent information architecture, reusable UI components, and a strict performance budget to keep key pages fast while still supporting discovery and promo browsing.

## Outcome

The platform delivered a unified experience for travel search, promo discovery, and destination planning, aligning with tripmydream’s positioning as a service for finding and comparing flights and hotels and helping users plan trips based on preferences and budget.
