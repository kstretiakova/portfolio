## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating the often tedious design handover process. The goal was to create a pipeline that converts Figma designs directly into clean, production-ready code. By integrating design tokens, component libraries, and automated workflows, this solution significantly reduced the time spent on translating design assets into code, while maintaining design consistency across the product.

## Key Features

- **Backend with PHP Plugins**: Developed custom PHP plugins to handle complex booking requests, yacht crew forms, and interactive travel itineraries without relying on heavy third-party plugins.
- **Custom WordPress & WooCommerce Setup**: Built a flexible platform to showcase luxury travel itineraries, yacht charters, retreats, and exclusive experiences. Integrated WooCommerce for booking logic and dynamic product structures.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Styled-Components**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.
- **Content Flexibility**: Created reusable templates and content blocks so that the Mizla team could easily add new tours, retreats, and yacht listings with consistent branding.
- **Multilingual and SEO Optimization**: Implemented multilingual support and optimized SEO for travel keywords, ensuring visibility across international markets.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: For backend plugin development and custom booking logic.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For frontend customization and responsive UI.
- **WordPress + WooCommerce**: For CMS and booking/e-commerce features.
- **Polylang / Loco Translate**: For multilingual capabilities.
- **MySQL**: For storing bookings, tours, and yacht data.



## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was creating a system flexible enough to handle different types of products (yacht charters, tours, retreats) while keeping the design consistent. Building custom PHP plugins allowed integration of unique booking forms and itinerary layouts. Another learning was balancing automation with luxury branding - using AI to draft content saved time, but required manual curation to maintain Mizlaâ€™s high-end tone.

## Outcome

The Mizla platform successfully launched as a polished, scalable solution for luxury travel and yacht experiences. It allows the team to publish new itineraries quickly, attract international clients with multilingual support, and manage bookings seamlessly. AI-assisted workflows reduced content production time, while custom PHP plugins gave Mizla unique features that differentiated them from competitors.
