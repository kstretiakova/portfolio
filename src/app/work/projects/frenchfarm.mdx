## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was migrating the entire product catalog and SEO structure from Shopify to WooCommerce without losing rankings. Ensuring smooth multilingual checkout experiences across different languages and currencies also required careful plugin customization. Building custom PHP plugins allowed balancing flexibility with maintainability. Using AI for multilingual content accelerated delivery but required careful review for accuracy and compliance with local regulations.

## Outcome

The FrenchFarm website now runs on a robust WordPress + WooCommerce setup with multilingual support and custom backend logic. This migration reduced operating costs, improved SEO, and gave the team full control over product management, enabling faster updates, multilingual scaling, and more efficient content workflows through AI assistance.
